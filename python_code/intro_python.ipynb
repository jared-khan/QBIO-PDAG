    "Indexing for lists is much like R, except we start at 0. We use the following syntax to access the i'th element of the list: `list_name[i]`, where i is the index of the list. Python also has slicing, where you can access multiple elements of a list with `list_name[i:j]`. Slicing excludes the j'th element. Finally, a really cool trick to read from the back of the list is to use negative indexing. `list_name[-i]` will access the i'th element starting from the back of the list."

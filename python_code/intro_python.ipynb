When you set up your conda environment, we had you install the packages listed in `requirements.txt`. One main difference between package installation in R and Python is that Python packages need to be installed in the Terminal. If you ever want to import a package but it is not found, you need to install it! There are two main ways to install packages in your conda environment. `conda install package_name` uses Anaconda's installation to install the package. Another common way to install a package is using `pip install package_name`. Understanding the difference in these two commands is not needed. **Note: NOT all packages are available for install on both `conda` and `pip`.

    "\n",
    "Processing files is pretty easy in Python. When looking for files, Python searches in the directory from which you run Python code. Changing directories requires the use of a different library. To open a file, use `with open(filename, 'r/w') as name:` for the syntax. `r/w` stand for read/write modes; we specify one or the other to indicate our purpose for opening a file. Sometimes, we just need to read in data, and other times we want to directly edit the file. Note that if we do `w` mode, then we can open a file that doesn't exist yet and write into it. Being explicit about the purpose is good practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "After we read in the file, it is stored as a Python object. We need to use other functions to read or write the actual content of the files. Here, we will introduce `.readlines()`, though there are other ones you can find by Googling. Below are two examples of the above syntax:"

    "Lists are powerful data structures in Python. As you saw before, they can contain a mixture of different data types (though usually don't in practice), and Python also offers a few operations and functions to parse information from a list. Lists are known as a **mutable** data type - you can edit them as you please. An example of an immutable data type is a tuple. Tuples are a bit niche though and lists see more use by far. Here are a few examples of some of the operations that Python supports."
